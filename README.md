# Querying-Data-in-S3 with SQL

<h1>Querying Data in S3 with Amazon Athena with SQL</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Consider a retail company managing a vast repository of customer transaction data in S3. With this project, the company can seamlessly query and analyze purchasing patterns, identify popular products, and optimize inventory management. The SQL querying capabilities of Amazon Athena provide actionable insights, enabling the company to make informed decisions for business growth.Company ABC is deploying a new web application that helps customers to upload files to S3 Bucket. As a part of the infrastructure, the Administrator needs to be notified via EmailÂ whenever an object is put into their S3 bucket.

<br/><p align="center"><br/><img src="https://imgur.com/n27dgz6.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/><br/> 

<h2>Task 5: Query table in Athena:</h2>

SQL query capabilities of Amazon Athena to interact with and analyze the data stored in the created table. By executing SQL statements in the Athena Query Editor.

Make sure you are in the N.Virginia Region.

Navigate to Services menu in the top, then click on Athena in the Analytics section.

In the left sidebar, Click on Query Editor

Switch the G5UPWorkgroup at the top right.

<br/><p align="center"><br/><img src="https://imgur.com/04aZb9P.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/><br/> 

To get the results of all expenses types under expense_category of Food, paste the following SQL statement into the query editor

SELECT * FROM "g5upgluedb"."g5up-sample-table" WHERE expense_category = 'Food';

<br/><p align="center"><br/><img src="https://imgur.com/a4Hrfb1.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/><br/> 

Note: To execute the queries through the keyboard directly, use the shortcut Ctrl + Enter (For windows) or Tab + Enter (For Mac)

You can play around with some queries like:

If you want to list all distinct expense categories Foood, Shipping,, Transportation and Office, along with their respective counts, you can type the following code

SELECT expense_category, COUNT(DISTINCT expense_type) AS expense_type_count
FROM "g5upgluedb"."g5up-sample-table"
WHERE expense_category IN ('Food', 'Shipping', 'Transportation', 'Office')
GROUP BY expense_category;

<br/><p align="center"><br/><img src="https://imgur.com/vlZgdtn.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/><br/> 

If you want to get a total number of rows present by running the following SQL statement:

SELECT count(*) FROM "g5upgluedb"."g5up-sample-table";

<h2>Do You Know?:</h2>
Athena's serverless nature allows users to analyze data stored in S3 without the need for any infrastructure provisioning or management. This means that users can focus solely on querying and analyzing their data without worrying about setting up and maintaining servers or clusters. The pay-per-query pricing model of Amazon Athena ensures cost efficiency, as users are only charged for the actual queries they run. This flexibility and cost-effectiveness make Amazon Athena a powerful and convenient tool for data analysis tasks in AWS.

<h2>Recommendations:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Optimize Data Storage:</b> Consider optimizing the storage format and structure of your data in Amazon S3, as it can impact query performance. Formats like Parquet or ORC may provide better performance than CSV, especially for large datasets.</li>

  <li><b>Partitioning Data:</b> If your dataset is large, consider partitioning it based on certain columns. This can significantly improve query performance by allowing Athena to skip irrelevant data when querying.</li>

  <li><b>Cost Management:</b> Keep an eye on costs, especially if your queries involve large amounts of data. Athena follows a pay-per-query pricing model, so optimizing your queries and managing the data structure can help control costs.</li>

  <li><b>Regular Data Catalog Updates:</b> Ensure that the AWS Glue Data Catalog is regularly updated to reflect changes in your S3 data. This ensures that Athena has accurate metadata for efficient query execution.</li>

  <li><b>Query Performance Tuning:</b> Monitor and analyze query performance regularly. Identify and optimize frequently executed or resource-intensive queries to improve overall system efficiency.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Understanding Workgroups:</b> Creating a separate workgroup (G5UPWorkgroup) provides a way to customize query execution environments. Understanding workgroup settings, such as result location and encryption, is essential for efficient query execution.</li>

  <li><b>Database and Table Creation in Glue:</b> The process of creating databases and tables in AWS Glue is crucial for organizing and managing metadata. Consistent naming conventions and accurate configurations facilitate seamless interaction with Athena.</li>

  <li><b>Column and Data Type Considerations:</b> When creating tables in Glue, careful consideration of column names and data types is essential. This directly impacts the accuracy of queries and the overall effectiveness of data analysis.</li>

  <li><b>Utilizing Athena Query Editor:</b> The Athena Query Editor provides a convenient way to interactively run SQL queries. Understanding its features, shortcuts, and how to switch between workgroups is beneficial for a smooth querying experience.</li>

  <li><b>Exploring Querying Capabilities:</b> Experimenting with various SQL queries helps in exploring the full querying capabilities of Amazon Athena. Understanding how to filter, group, and aggregate data provides valuable insights for data analysis.</li>
